Working hard every day to find new techniques to achieve a better use of the energies that have been around us for a long time in our planet.</font></p><p><font size="4">Our alma mater is Professor Armando Regusci Campomar,   who together with some dreamers had been engaged for a long time in this mission.</font></p><p><font size="4">Prof. Regusci has been concerned for the environment since teenage years in his bachelor of engineer, when the world was not worried about wasting fossil energies.</font></p><p><font size="4"> He started inventing engines that use renewable energies .During 1959 he drove in Montevideo streets, a strange vehicle that surprised neighbors.  It was “The Hidrosvol”, a car with a flywheel and hydrostatic transmission which participated in several opportunities at the race circuit of El Pinar.</font></p><p><font size="4">The same year he came up with the idea of building engines using compressed air and nitrogen like a fuel, and present several patents with this innovation in the coming years.</font></p><p><font size="4">We must underline his expertise is not only theory, because in those years he also worked in a floating dock doing navy repairs  and handling all kind of industrial machinery.</font></p><p><font size="4">Prof. Regusci kept working and researching in the following decades, trying to improve his Inventions, designing more prototypes of motorbikes and cars, applying for many patents not only in Uruguay but around the world. Having several interviews in magazines, radio, and international TV networks-</font></p><p><font size="4">All these efforts faced the indifference and silence of the local and overseas authorities and the lack of support of the organizations who claim protect the environment looking for a solution for the global warming.</font></p><p><font size="4">In 2005 he create with his family and close friends the Regusci Air Company, seven hundred share-holders  who trust  on this enterprise and up today  are supporting  its efforts , that no matter the circumstances is committed more and more to put on the market the air compressed vehicles, highly efficient and no pollutant.</font></p><p><font size="4">Another brunch of the company is dedicated to the research  for the construction of the compressed air storage tank, named air batteries; also compressed air engines to power a generator to produce electricity with these air batteries; stationary compressors to compress the air moved by wind mills; and systems to compress the air from the sun energy.</font></p><p><font size="4">There are several patents about this system presented by Prof. Regusci that supposed a huge investment to protect the main patrimony of our company.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="4" color="#ffffff">How to collaborate: if you or your company, organization, community are concerned and compromised with a real global change in energetic policies and not just a speech merely palliative, you can help us in many ways; spreading the word, collaborating, buying shares, demanding to your local and national representatives a real action about this subject with real support to this kind of enterprise. </font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="4" color="#ffffff">The Regusci Engine works. That is an undeniable reality. The world can be moved using this system, without pollution and without oil. The costs of transportation can be diminished in a 10 %. In Uruguay, an urban bus ticket could cost 2 pesos (10 cents US$), a car could run 10 kilometers for 3 pesos (15 cents U$S) against the 30 pesos that costs one liter of oil to run the same 10 kilometers.</font></p><p><font size="4" color="#ffffff">This is real and that is the problem.</font></p><p><font size="4" color="#ffffff">There are Huge Interests in the world which extend their tentacles through frontiers and governments. The Regusci Engine is not compatible with these interests and because of that; this enterprise has been trunked over and over again, starting with the Uruguayan government. It is not even a political problem, since 3 of the main political parties have been in power and the answer has always been the same.</font></p><p><font size="4" color="#ffffff">Through the years, Professor Regusci had received countless threats because of this “subversive activity” which attempts against the energetic monopoly that the Big Fishes possess and defend in their territory, The World.</font></p><p><font size="4" color="#ffffff">On November 28th of 2006, these threats became fact and the apartment that Prof. Regusci´s lived in with his family in Maldonado, was burnt down. </font></p><p style="line-height: normal"><font size="4" color="#ffffff">We know that we are fighting against the system, we know and we live in bare skin what can happen to us if we continue with this fight, we are not scared, we are convinced, and every time we get attacked, it just reassures our convictions and makes us stronger to pursue a real change for our Planet.</font></p></div></div></div><div id="zB"><div id="zB-widget-layout-wrap" class="widget-layout-wrap " rel=""><div class="modWrap"></div></div></div><div id="zC"><div id="zC-widget-layout-wrap" class="widget-layout-wrap " rel=""><div class="modWrap"></div></div></div></div></div></div><div xmlns="" id="ft"><div id="fWrapper"><div id="fContent"><div id="footerContent" class="editorWrap"><div id="footerZoneElement" class="editable rte flexContent" rel="itemGuid.sit.fc.001"><p>Copyright 2011 REGUSCIAIR.
